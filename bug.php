In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object properties that might not be set.  Directly accessing a property without checking for its existence can lead to unexpected behavior or fatal errors, particularly when working with data from external sources or user input. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```php
class User {
    public string $name;
    public string $email;
}

$user = new User();
$userName = $user->name; // Potential error here
$userEmail = $user->email; //And here
```

The `$user` object's properties `name` and `email` are not initialized with any values. Thus, accessing them directly would likely result in a `Notice: Undefined property` warning at best. In stricter contexts or with certain error handlers, this can cause a fatal error, halting script execution.
