The most effective way to avoid such errors is to always check for the existence of a property before accessing it.  PHP offers several ways to accomplish this:

1. **Using `isset()`:** The `isset()` function checks if a variable is set and is not NULL.  This is suitable for checking object properties:

```php
class User {
    public string $name;
    public string $email;
}

$user = new User();

$userName = isset($user->name) ? $user->name : 'N/A'; //Use a default if not set
$userEmail = isset($user->email) ? $user->email : 'N/A'; //Or a default
```

2. **Null Coalescing Operator (`??`):** Introduced in PHP 7.0, the null coalescing operator provides a concise way to provide a default value if a variable is null or not set:

```php
$userName = $user->name ?? 'N/A';
$userEmail = $user->email ?? 'N/A';
```

3. **Optional Chaining (`?->`):**  Introduced in PHP 8.0, optional chaining allows for gracefully handling cases where a property might not exist in the object.  If the property is not set, the expression short-circuits and evaluates to `null`. 

```php
$userName = $user?->name ?? 'N/A';
$userEmail = $user?->email ?? 'N/A';
```

Choose the method that best suits your coding style and PHP version.  Always prioritize robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and ensure the stability of your application.
