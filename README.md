# PHP: Handling Uninitialized Object Properties

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: accessing object properties that might not be initialized.  Directly accessing uninitialized properties can lead to unexpected behavior, warnings, or even fatal errors.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a solution using property checks.

This example highlights the importance of defensive programming and robust error handling in PHP applications.
